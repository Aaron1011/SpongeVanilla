Granite
======

Granite - A different API for Minecraft 1.8+.
This is _not_ Sponge!

The purpose of this API is to take a "hands off" approach to vanilla code.  
That is, we _describe_ the code to our composite layer, without actually including any of it.
Access is gained by composite classes, reflection, proxy classes and interfaces, and classloaders.

To-do list
------
- ~~Set-up~~
- ~~Command proxy~~
- ~~Plugin loader~~
- **Command API**
- **Event proxy**
- API for worlds, items, players
- Essentials-style example plugin
- ???
